        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>GeSec is dedicated to fostering a collaborative, ethical, and respectful environment where members can learn, share knowledge, and develop skills in cybersecurity. This Code of Conduct outlines expected behavior and ensures a safe and legal learning space for all members.</p>

        <p>All participants are expected to show basic decency and common sense. Be kind to each other. If you are asked to stop, stop. If you donâ€™t stop, you will be banned.</p>

        <p>Below is a list of unacceptable behaviour, which cannot be considered exhaustive. We have ZERO tolerance for the following behaviour:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Harassment of any form related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), education or technology choices.</li>
            <li>Committing unlawful activity.</li>
            <li>Exploiting or hacking anything that is either not part of a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge or has otherwise not been authorised.</li>
            <li>Failure to obey rules of the venue.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Anyone who commits unacceptable behaviour will be subject to any action deemed appropriate by the organisers (i.e. verbal warnings, expulsion, pre-emptive bans from future events, etc).</p>

        <p>If you witness any unacceptable behaviour, please notify an organiser as soon as possible. All concerns raised will be taken seriously. However, it is up to the discretion of the organisers to determine when and how a reported incident will be addressed.</p>
